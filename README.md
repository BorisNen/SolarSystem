# SolarSystem
  This is a scaled down model of our solar system made in opengl as a coursework.
  It uses data from NASA, in order to match the planet and orbit ratio. The camera can be moved, rotated or fixed on a selected planet.
  Movement is done with the mouse. Press and hold the left button to rotate and the right button to move forward and backward.
  You can select the planets with the numbers 1-8 on the keyboard, speed up with '+', slow down with '-',
  pause the program with 'p' or remove the orbits with 'o'.
  
  In order to run the program, you need to download the project, build and run (used libraries are listed below).
  This is a visual studio project, so you can import the SolarSystem.sln into visual studio 
  and use NuGet to install the necessary libraries.
